rubik-cube
==========


Introduction
------------

This is a little demo as an exercise to learn the C API of Lua.
The Rubik's Cube group is a subgroup of S48 generated by the 6 face rotations,
  {F, B, U, D, L, R}.
So I just implement these 6 moves and most of the code (cube_move_*) is generated
by a program located in /tool.
